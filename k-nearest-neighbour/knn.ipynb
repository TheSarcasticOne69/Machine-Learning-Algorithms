        "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, intuitive, and powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it works:\n",
        "* KNN classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified. The algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Stores all training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Calculates the distance (commonly Euclidean) between a new point and all training points.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Selects the k closest neighbors.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Assigns the most common class among those neighbors to the new point (in classification tasks).\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Characteristics:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Lazy learning algorithm: It doesn't learn an internal model during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Non-parametric: No assumptions about the underlying data distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Distance-based: Sensitive to the scale of data, so feature normalization is important.\n",

        "Use Cases:\n",
        "Commonly used in recommendation systems, image recognition, and classification tasks such as the Iris dataset.\n",
